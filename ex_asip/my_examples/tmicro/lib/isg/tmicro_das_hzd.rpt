// This file reports all potential pipeline hazards in tmicro,
// and lists where sw_stall rules are added to avoid them.
// These added sw_stall rules complement user-defined hw_stall and bypass rules,
// and never overlap with them.

// Also simple sw_stall rules are proposed in nML syntax, but these may OVERLAP
// with user-defined hw_stall or bypass rules:
// - don't just copy, but make them specific to eliminate overlap,
// - or rely on the internally added sw_stall rules.

// The (new) default pipeline hazard covering algorithm may add sw_stall rules
// that overlap with other, user-defined sw_stall rules, when the latter
// only partially cover a dependency.This overlap can be avoided by setting
// nML property 'property allow_overlapping_sw_stalls: false;'

// Use option +d4, +d8, +d12, +d16 for increasingly more details on
// the pipeline hazards and how they are covered.

// The old hazard covering algorithm is still used for odd +d values:
// +d1,+d5,+d7,+d9,+d11,... 
// +d3 (non-recommended) checks dependencies on the nML source line level,
// and may add much more sw_stall rules that each cover less instructions.
// For even +d values not a multiple of 4 (+d2,+d6,+d10...) the new hazards
// covering is executed after the old algorithm.

// with the animal -v (verbose) option ALL SOURCE REFERENCES are printed;
// without it ONLY ONE source reference is printed for each operation.

// with option -n source line references with nML derivation paths are printed
// (this may be slow when more references are printed for higher +d levels)

// with option -s (combined with +d level higher than 1) instructions are
// printed as bit-string patterns (may be slow)

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file was created without option +d (or with option +d0).
// Use option +d as described above to investigate the pipeline hazards,
// see source references, etc.
