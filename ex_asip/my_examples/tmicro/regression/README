NOTE: As of the L-2016.09 release, a new approach is applied to Tmicro.  
The C based regression tests are now instatiated from a generic location.  
For more information, consult the examples/regression/HOWTO.txt document.

Regression testbench tests the functionality of the ASIP. The subdirectories
names are structured in the following way:

[ACFMPS][number][_fX][name]

[ACMPS]  : A = Assembly tests
           C = Generic C tests
           F = Floating point tests
           I = Test that only work with test_irq.prx
           L = Test of libraries
           M = Memory tests
           P = Programs/testbenches
           S = Specific tests for this ASIP
[number] : number of the test
[_fX]    : _ = test is enabled
           f = test is only enabled for full run
           X = test is disabled (not applicable)
[name]   : short name of the test
